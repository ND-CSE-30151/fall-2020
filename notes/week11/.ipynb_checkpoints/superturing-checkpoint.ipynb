    "There aren't any notes for this topic save for one \"no\" argument that is technical. Turing called it \"the mathematical objection\" and it is usually known today as the Penrose-Lucas argument. This version is due to Penrose and comes from [an article criticizing him](http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/pub/lafortehayesford.pdf). \n",

    "Let $R$ be a decider Turing machine that detects _some_ cases of looping. That is, on input $\\langle M, w\\rangle$, if $R$ accepts, then $M$ loops on input $w$. But if $R$ rejects, it doesn't mean anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we go through the usual diagonalization argument; the only difference is that it doesn't lead to a contradiction, but to a machine/input pair that is beyond $R$'s detection abilities. Assume an ordering $M_1, M_2, \\ldots$ on Turing machines and an ordering $w_1, w_2, \\ldots$ on strings. We can build a big table with the results of $R$ on all machines and inputs:\n",

    "Now, there must be an $i$ such that $D = M_i$. We claim that $\\langle D, w_i\\rangle$ is an example of a looping machine/input pair that is beyond $R$'s detection abilities. Suppose that $R$, on input $\\langle D, w_i\\rangle$, detects looping. Then, in fact, $D$ does not loop, which is a contradiction. So $R$ must not detect looping. Then, in fact, $D$ does loop, but $R$ does not detect it.\n",

    "Then, by the above argument, there is a machine/input pair $\\langle D, w_i\\rangle$ that loops, but $Y$ rejects it.  By the definition of $Y$, you are not able to detect that $\\langle D, w_i\\rangle$ loops. But if you understood the above argument, then you know that $\\langle D, w_i\\rangle$ does loop. This is a contradiction! Therefore, you are not equivalent to a Turing machine.\n",
